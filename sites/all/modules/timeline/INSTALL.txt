INSTALLATION
------------
1. Copy all the module files into a subdirectory called sites/all/modules/timeline/
   under your Drupal installation directory.

2. Go to administer >> modules and enable the timeline module.
   Ensure that the Views module is installed and enabled.

3. Go to administer >> settings >> timeline to review and change the configuration options to your liking.
   See "Local Installation" instructions to install the timeline libraries on your server.

4. See README.txt for information on creating timeline views.


LOCAL INSTALLATION
-------------------
By default, the SIMILE Timeline (and Ajax) libraries can be used from the SIMILE server. 
But if you want to install them locally you can follow these steps:

1. Follow general instructions step 1 and 2.

2. Obtain the libraries of SIMILE Timeline 2.3.0 and SIMILE Ajax 2.0-on-static-simile.

   * You can download a prepackaged and patched (see known issues) version from
     http://github.com/xamanu/SIMILE-Timeline-libraries/tree/master (press download button)

   * Or you can check out via Subversion the original files from the SIMILE servers:
     svn export http://simile-widgets.googlecode.com/svn/timeline/tags/2.3.0/src/webapp/api timeline_js
     svn export http://simile-widgets.googlecode.com/svn/ajax/tags/2.0-on-static-simile/src/webapp/api timeline_ajax 
     (Please note that you might want to patch the simile-ajax-bundle.js, see known issues)
     
3. Place the two libraries into a new sites/all/libraries/simile_timeline directory.
   Note: timeline libraries have to be inside the folder: timeline_js
         ajax libraries have to be inside the folder: timeline_ajax

4. Go to administer >> settings >> timeline and activate local use. Check error messages on this page to 
   be sure that everything is going to be included properly. 


KNOWN ISSUES:
-----------------------
1. The SIMILE Ajax libraries includes a __history__.html, which produces an 404 (not found) error [1].
You can path the libraries/simile_timeline/timeline_ajax/simile-ajax-bundle.js in line 1945 setting "enabled:false"
There is no way to avoid this when using the SIMILE server as the source for the libraries.
